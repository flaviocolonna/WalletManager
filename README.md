# Wallet Manager
Wallet Manager is a web app to manage own wallet, registering incomes and withdrawals.
## How it works?
It is very simple to use this web app. There are only two main functions: add income and add withdrawal.
When you add an income or a withdrawal, we will see the list of amounts of your own wallet in a table, order by date.
You will see the total of your wallet above the table.
Remember that you cannot register a negative amount.
Another important function is resetting your wallet.
From the menu in the navigation bar, positioned at the top of the page, you can refresh the page clicking on the 'Home' button, or reset your wallet or view the source of the page.
