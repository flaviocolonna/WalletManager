# WalletManager
Wallet Manager is a web app to manage own wallet, registering incomes and withdrawals.
## How it works?
It is very simple to use this web app. There are only two main functions: add income and add withdrawal.
When you add an income or a withdrawal, we will see the list of amounts of your own wallet in a table, order by date.
You will see the total of your wallet above the table.
Remember that you cannot register a negative amount.
Another important function is resetting your wallet.
##Offline working!
This web app is built to works in offline mode.
